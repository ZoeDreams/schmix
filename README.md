## schmix

This project is a collection of my experiments with the Web Audio API and an isomorphic architecture with React and Redux.

I will be adding new effects, gizmos, what-nots as I develop them. I'm also maintaining a host with the latest and greatest available here: https://schmix.herokuapp.com
